### How can I make application great again?
1. Don't hesitate to report issues
1. Have a great idea? Don't waste your time, fork the project, commit changes, open a pull request!
1. Have an idea and don't have time? Open an issue with "discussion" label.
1. Have an idea and hate javascript? You already know what to do, just take a look on the previous item
