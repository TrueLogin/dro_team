# Welcome brand new darts scores counter!

### Like any other counter, unlike any other counter! &copy; Apple, Inc.

The rule is simple:
- Reach out 501 score

But:
1. there are **up to 5 players**
1. **game is going on** even if one of the players reaches 501
1. so you can take **the second** or **the third** place, awesome, isn't it?

Are you curious? Of course you are! Just give it a [try](https://truelogin.github.io/dro_team/)!
